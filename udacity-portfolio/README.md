# Udacity Portfolio Site

This project provides the front end for a portfolio website which will eventually include all
completed projects for the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer program. A design mockup was
provided as a guideline for this project which can be viewed [here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/November/5a136147_design-mockup-portfolio/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf). 
Additional customizations were made to this design mockup, including custom images, content, links, font style,
and buttons. This project is made with HTML and CSS and is made responsive with media queries and Flexbox. 
This is the second project for the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer nanodegree.
